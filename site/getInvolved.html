      <h4>The Mural Brigade wants YOU!</h4>
      <p>
      There is much work to be done before the murals make it to the walls of GMU.  Behind the scenes, we have set up a club called the Mural Brigade which you can find and join here!
      </p>
      <p>
      The Mural Brigade aims to keep everyone on the team organized as we move forward applying for grants, creating and implementing marketing plans, collecting monetary support, and turning the dream of a fresh, new campus into a reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Made up of students and faculty of various backgrounds, we currently have meetings 4 days a week with a “come as you please” system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can’t make it for the whole meeting?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>No problem.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Need to leave early for class?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Go ahead.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand that students have busy schedules but by working together, we will be able to accomplish great things as we come closer to the completion of the project!
    </p>
